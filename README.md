## Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the ratings and reviews data from Zomato to gain insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, and factors influencing ratings. By exploring this data, we aim to understand what contributes to high or low ratings on the platform and how these insights can be leveraged for business decision-making.

## Key Components:

# Data Cleaning and Preparation:

- Cleaning the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
- Preparing the data for analysis by structuring it into a suitable format for visualization and statistical modeling.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Conducting EDA to understand the distribution of ratings, review sentiments, and relationships between variables such as cuisine types, locations, and ratings.
- Visualizing trends and patterns using charts, graphs, and heatmaps to identify popular cuisines, highly rated restaurants, and geographic preferences.

## Sentiment Analysis:

- Using natural language processing techniques to analyze customer reviews sentimentally. This helps in understanding the sentiment associated with different rating categories.

# Predictive Modeling:

- Building predictive models to forecast restaurant ratings based on factors such as cuisine, location, price range, etc.
- Evaluating model performance and deriving actionable insights for improving restaurant ratings.

## Interactive Dashboard:

- Developing an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to visualize key findings and insights.
- Providing filters for users to explore ratings by cuisine, location, price range, etc., and to compare performance metrics across restaurants.

# Benefits:
